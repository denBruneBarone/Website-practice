# Website-practice
Various sites created with the intention of learning.🦖

Sorted in folders:
  Tests: small tests of different functionalities. Not very interesting to a viewer. 😞
  Excercises: Excercises given in class. Mostly smaller JS-functions. Also not that interesting. 😞
  Projects: Larger projects. Incorporates HTML, CSS and JS. Inteded as a standalone project. Potentially interesting ✔️😍
